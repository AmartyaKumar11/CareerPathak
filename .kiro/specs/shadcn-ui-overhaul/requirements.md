# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a complete UI overhaul of the CareerPathak application to ensure consistent usage of shadcn/ui components throughout the entire interface, with improved visual hierarchy through contrasting button colors and enhanced user experience.

### Requirement 5
