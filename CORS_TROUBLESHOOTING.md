# CORS Error Troubleshooting

## The Issue
The error you encountered:
```
The fetch of the id assertion endpoint resulted in a network error: ERR_FAILED
Server did not send the correct CORS headers.
FedCM get() rejects with IdentityCredentialError
```

This is a **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** error that occurs when Google's OAuth service blocks requests from localhost.

## What I've Fixed

### 1. **Disabled FedCM** 
- Added `use_fedcm_for_prompt: false` to disable the problematic FedCM feature
- This should resolve the CORS errors

### 2. **Added Multiple Authentication Methods**
- **Google OAuth Button**: Uses Google's native sign-in button
- **Popup OAuth Flow**: Fallback method using popup windows
- **Mock Sign-In**: For testing without Google OAuth (development only)

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Better error logging and debugging information
- Fallback mechanisms when one method fails

## Testing Options

### Option 1: Google OAuth (Recommended)
1. Configure your Google Cloud Console properly (see OAUTH_SETUP.md)
2. Use the Google sign-in button

### Option 2: Mock Authentication (Development)
1. Click "Continue with Test Account" button (only visible in development)
2. This bypasses Google OAuth for testing the app functionality

### Option 3: If CORS Still Occurs
The popup method opens Google OAuth in a separate window, which should avoid CORS issues entirely.

## Next Steps
1. **Refresh your browser** at http://localhost:8080
2. **Try the authentication** - you should see multiple sign-in options now
3. **Use the mock sign-in** if Google OAuth still has issues
4. **Check browser console** for any remaining errors

The mock sign-in will let you test the full application flow while you troubleshoot the Google OAuth configuration.
