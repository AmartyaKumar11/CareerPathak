# 🔐 SECURITY REMINDER

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Your Google OAuth Client ID is NOT in the repository

Your `.env` file containing the Google OAuth Client ID has been **safely excluded** from the git repository thanks to the `.gitignore` file.

### What's Protected:
- ✅ `.env` file (contains your Google Client ID)
- ✅ All environment files (`.env.local`, `.env.production`, etc.)
- ✅ OAuth secrets and API keys
- ✅ Service account files

### What's Public:
- ✅ `.env.example` file (template without real credentials)
- ✅ All source code
- ✅ Documentation and setup guides

### For Future Collaborators:
1. They will need to create their own `.env` file
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Add their own Google OAuth Client ID
4. Follow the setup instructions in `OAUTH_SETUP.md`

### Your Client ID Location:
Your actual client ID (`890781320737-rhhut03rrv91dfv6da7davlrhvnsdm0r.apps.googleusercontent.com`) is **only** stored locally in your `.env` file and is **NOT** pushed to GitHub.

**✅ Your secrets are safe!** 🔒
